# ExoPlanet

## Description

**ExoPlanet** provides a graphical interface for the construction, evaluation and application of a machine learning model in predictive analysis. With the back-end built using the **numpy** and **scikit-learn** libraries, **ExoPlanet** couples fast and well tested algorithms, a UI designed over the **Qt4** framework, and graphs rendered using **Matplotlib** to provide the user with a *rich interface, rapid analytics and interactive visuals*.

**ExoPlanet** is designed to have a minimal learning curve, allowing researchers to focus more on the applicative aspect of machine learning algorithms rather than their implementation details. It supports both methods of learning, providing algorithms for unsupervised and supervised training, which may be done with continuous or discrete labels. The parameters for each algorithm can be tweaked to ensure optimum performance. Training data is read from a CSV file, and after training is complete, **ExoPlanet** automates building the visual representations for the trained model. Once training and evaluation yield satisfactory results, the model may be applied for data based predictions on a new data set.
